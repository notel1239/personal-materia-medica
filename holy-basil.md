# Holy Basil (*Ocimum sanctum*)

## Historical Use and Origin
Holy Basil, also known as Tulsi, is a sacred plant in Hinduism and has been used for over 3,000 years in Ayurvedic medicine. Native to the Indian subcontinent, it is often grown in household courtyards and temples for its spiritual significance and medicinal properties. Traditionally, it has been employed as a *rasayana* (rejuvenator) to promote longevity, resilience, and overall well‑being. It is considered an “adaptogen” that helps the body cope with stress and maintain homeostasis.

## Key Active Compounds
The main bioactive constituents of holy basil include:
- **Eugenol**: A volatile phenolic compound with anti‑inflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities.
- **Ursolic acid**: A triterpenoid known for its anti‑inflammatory, anti‑cancer, and hepatoprotective effects.
- **Rosmarinic acid**: A polyphenol with strong antioxidant and anti‑inflammatory properties.
- **Ocimumosides** and **ocimum‑glycosides**: Unique compounds that contribute to its adaptogenic and anti‑stress actions.
- **Essential oils** rich in methyl chavicol (estragole), linalool, and β‑caryophyllene.

## Primary Claimed Curative Properties
- **Adaptogenic and Anti‑stress**: Modulates cortisol levels, supports adrenal function, and improves the body’s resistance to physical, emotional, and environmental stressors.
- **Immunomodulatory**: Enhances innate and adaptive immune responses, increases natural killer cell activity, and may reduce susceptibility to infections.
- **Anti‑inflammatory and Antioxidant**: Scavenges free radicals, reduces oxidative stress, and lowers inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF‑α, IL‑6).
- **Metabolic Support**: Helps regulate blood glucose levels, improves lipid profile, and may support weight management.
- **Respiratory Health**: Traditionally used to relieve cough, cold, bronchitis, and asthma due to its expectorant and bronchodilatory effects.
- **Neuroprotective**: May improve memory, cognitive function, and mood, and has been studied for its potential in managing anxiety and depression.

## Potential Side Effects and Contraindications
- **Generally recognized as safe** when consumed in culinary amounts or as a tea; long‑term supplemental use is also considered safe for most people.
- **Possible side effects**: Mild gastrointestinal discomfort, allergic reactions (rare), and, in very high doses, potential liver enzyme elevation due to estragole content.
- **Contraindications**:
  - Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Limited safety data; best to avoid therapeutic doses.
  - Bleeding disorders: May slow blood clotting; caution before surgery.
  - Hypoglycemia: May lower blood glucose; monitor if taking diabetes medications.
- **Drug interactions**: May enhance effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and hypoglycemic agents. Could theoretically interfere with immunosuppressants.

## Common Preparation Methods
- **Fresh Leaves**: Chewed directly or added to salads, chutneys, and culinary dishes.
- **Tea (Tulsi Tea)**: Steep 1–2 teaspoons of dried leaves or 5–10 fresh leaves in hot water for 5–10 minutes; drink 1–3 cups daily.
- **Powder (Churna)**: Dried leaf powder mixed with water, honey, or ghee; typical dose is 1–2 grams per day.
- **Tincture**: Liquid extract (1:5 ratio in alcohol) taken as 2–4 mL up to three times daily.
- **Capsules/Tablets**: Standardized extracts (usually 300–500 mg per capsule) providing consistent levels of active compounds.
- **Essential Oil**: Diluted in a carrier oil for topical application or used in aromatherapy (not for internal use without professional guidance).
